# Project Description
Storytelling is one of the oldest human practices. Humans used storytelling as a method of communication, even before writing was invented.
Storyteller is a storytelling platform. It's a place where users can join, tell their stories, read other users' stories, and discuss these stories.

# Technology


# User stories
Three cases of user stories
1. As an unlogged user
- I should be able to explore communities, and read stories and comments within these communities
2. As a logged user
In addition to being able to do everything unlogged users can do:
- I should be able to see my profile, and other users' profiles
- I should be able to edit my account and my profile
- I should be able to post stories to my profile
- I should be able to see stories shared by other users on their profiles
- I should be able to join and leave communities
- I should be able to comment on stories in profiles and communities
- I should be able to add stories to the communities I join
- I should be able to leave a feedback to the admin
3. As an Admin
In addition to being able to do everything logged users can do:
- I should be able to see the feedback left by users
- I should be able to see a list of users
- I should be the only one able to edit communities
- I should be able to edit or delete anything on the app
