# Project 2 Evaluation

## Technical Requirements
**3: Excelling**
> The app contains eight models and implements user authentication, which goes beyond the technical requirements. Am I missing the Facebook log-in? Don't see it. 

## Creativity and Interface
**3: Excelling**
> The color scheme and design here are very  nice. You clearly put a lot of thought into this. I think the next step is to make this responsive. Also, maybe experiment with different fonts and not having the links look like links but maybe buttons instead.

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

## Deployment and Functionality
**3: Excelling**
> Application was successfully deployed.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**3: Excelling**
> Submission includes everything in previous category, as well as evidence of planning tools. I also love that you included future features you want to implement.
